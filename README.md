This is the code repository for [Flutter for Beginners - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/flutter-for-beginners-third-edition), published by Packt.

**An introductory guide to building cross-platform mobile applications with Flutter 3 and Dart**

## What is this book about?
There have been many attempts at creating frameworks that are truly cross-platform, but most struggle to create a native-like experience at high performance levels. Flutter achieves this with an elegant design and a wealth of third-party plugins, making it the future of mobile app development. If you are a mobile developer who wants to create rich and expressive native apps with the latest Google Flutter framework, this book is for you.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the core concepts of the Flutter framework and how it is used for cross-platform development
* Understand the fundamentals of the Dart programming language
* Work with Flutter widgets and learn the concepts of stateful and stateless widgets
* Add animation to your app using animated widgets and advanced animations techniques
* Master the complete development lifecycle, including testing and debugging

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into sub-folders within either the lib or test top-level folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
void main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
print('hello ${i + 1}');
}
}

```

## Running the code
To run the code you will need to specify which chapter you wish to run, and which main method to run within the chapter, because the code is split by chapter and, in some chapters, there are multiple files with main methods within them.
Use the following command with the correct chapter number and main file name:
flutter run -t lib/Chapter01/main.dart
