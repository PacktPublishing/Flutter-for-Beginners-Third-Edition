**Cross-platform mobile development from Hello, World! to app release with Flutter 3.10+ and Dart 3.x**

## What is this book about?
There have been many attempts at creating frameworks that are truly cross-platform, but most struggle to create a native-like experience at high performance levels. Flutter achieves this with an elegant design and a wealth of third-party plugins, making it the future of mobile app development. If you are a mobile developer who wants to create rich and expressive native apps with the latest Google Flutter framework, this book is for you.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the Flutter framework and cross-platform development
* Acclimate the fundamentals of the Dart programming language
* Explore Flutter widgets, the core widget library, and stateful and stateless widgets
* Discover the complete development lifecycle, including testing and debugging
* Get familiar with both the mobile and web app release processes
* Dig deeper into more advanced Flutter concepts like animation
* Explore common Flutter plugins ad how to use them
* Discover the Flutter community and how to stay up-to-date

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into sub-folders within either the lib or test top-level folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
void main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
print('hello ${i + 1}');
}
}

```

## Running the code
To run the code you will need to specify which chapter you wish to run, and which main method to run within the chapter, because the code is split by chapter and, in some chapters, there are multiple files with main methods within them.
Use the following command with the correct chapter number and main file name:
flutter run -t lib/Chapter01/main.dart
